# dotfiles

## Install

There is an install script included in the repo that will run everything up it will do the following:

- Install homebrew
- Install homebrew cask
- Install all the stuff I have mentioned below
- Symlink .zshrc from dotfiles to `~/.zshrc`
- Symlink init.vim from dotfiles to `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`

## Software

Software Managers - I download all of my software using these - even GUIs:

- MacOS: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Linux: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or default package manager for the distro
- Windows: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

Browser: [Brave](https://brave.com/)

Terminal: [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)

Shell: [Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

Favorite Colorscheme: [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) - I literally use this in everything

Version Managers:

- Node: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Ruby: [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
- Python: [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

IDEs and Editors - In order of preference:

1. [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) - configured initially with [vim-bootstrap](https://github.com/editor-bootstrap/vim-bootstrap) and tweaked to my liking
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - My goto GUI editor
3. [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/) - If I want an IDE for some reason these are the best IMO
   NOTE: I manage JetBrains IDEs through the [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app/) after installing it through brew

Software Versioning Platforms (I only use git):

- [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - Really good CI/CD
- [Github](https://github.com/) - They are catching up to Gitlab

Useful Software:

- [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) - man pages but wayyyy better
- [postman](https://www.postman.com/) - API Manager
- [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - If you don't use this you are dumb
- [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) - If you don't use this you are dumb
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containers are magic

- [SwaggerDocs](https://swagger.io/docs/) - Cuz API docs are important
